# Jot.ly-Tutorial
This is the project which resulted from following along with Bloc's Jot.ly tutorial. 
I did learn quite a bit from this project but mostly because I didn't realize that the tutorial was using an older version of the skeleton css framework than I had downloaded. Many bugs and frustrations ensued.
